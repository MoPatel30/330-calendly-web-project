# COMP330 Calendar Project


## About
This project mimics the Calendly.com application. The purpose of this project is to organize an appointment schedule and make sure that anyone that is creating an appointment will not book a spot that will conflict with any other appointment or appointment types.


## Languages/Tools/Services
Front-end: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Firebase, etc.

Back-end: TBD (External DB). Need to plan out first. Zoom API.

(Python for final test script?)
